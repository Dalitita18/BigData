# Decision Tree Classifier

A decision tree is a series of nodes, a directional graph that begins at the base with a single node and extends to the many leaf nodes that represent the categories that the tree can classify. Another way of thinking about a decision tree is like a flow chart, where the flow starts at the root node and ends with a decision made on the sheets.

# Naive Bayes

A Naive Bayes classifier is a probabilistic machine learning model that is used for the classification task. The crux of the classifier is based on Bayes' theorem. Using Bayes' theorem, we can find the probability that A will occur, since B has occurred. Here, B is the evidence and A is the hypothesis. The assumption made here is that the predictors / characteristics are independent. That is, the presence of a particular characteristic does not affect the other. That's why it's called naive.
